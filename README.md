# nbaBubbleViewer

Final project for CS448B. The data and images for this project are courtesy of NBA.com. Once the raw data were downloaded using the NBA API and a python script, they were cleaned, summarised, and packaged into json/csv files using the dplyr package in R. The visualizations were then generated using the d3.js library.
